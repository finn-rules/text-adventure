## Git Log

Game hints :
Look at the whiteboard to get the code to the first room. The code is 4972.

In this room, there is an icePick. Use this to boost your damage , and also, there is armor if you attack the computer.

In the commons, there is a key under the homework. If you "use" the homework you also get a stat buff. 
You can pick up this key and use it on the lab door. The code to the room (which you get by inspecting the door, or the sticky note) is 8888 (the amount of bits in a character in most cases). Use both to unlock the room.

In the lab, there is a tree. Pick up and use the dagger to boost your damage to destroy the tree, which gives you gold armor.
You're now probably strong enough to beat Osera in a fight. When you kill him, he will transfer the Golden key, which you can use to escape.
